# Digital-clock-sing-c
This C program creates a simple digital clock that displays the time in a continuously updating loop using the HH : MM : SS format. Rather than taking input from the system's current time, the clock begins at 00 : 00 : 00 and manually counts each second, incrementing the time variables accordingly.
